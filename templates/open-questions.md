# Open Questions: [FEATURE NAME]

**Template Version**: 1.1.0
**Created**: [DATE]
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: "$USER_IDEA"

## AI-Generated Critical Questions

*The following questions are dynamically generated by AI based on the user idea and require clarification to proceed accurately.*

### Research Phase Questions
- [AI FILLS - specific questions based on user idea and technical gaps]

### Feasibility Phase Questions  
- [AI FILLS - business/technical feasibility questions specific to the project]

### Architecture Phase Questions
- [AI FILLS - architecture and design questions based on complexity and requirements]

### Data Model Phase Questions
- [AI FILLS - data structure and relationship questions specific to the domain]

### Implementation Phase Questions
- [AI FILLS - development and deployment questions based on project scope]

## Assumptions Made (Pending Confirmation)

### Technical Assumptions
- [ ] Assumption: [Description] - Impact: [What happens if wrong]
- [ ] Assumption: [Description] - Impact: [What happens if wrong]

### Business Assumptions
- [ ] Assumption: [Description] - Impact: [What happens if wrong]
- [ ] Assumption: [Description] - Impact: [What happens if wrong]

## Decision Required

**How should the AI proceed?**

Choose one option:

### Option A: Continue with Assumptions
- AI will proceed with current assumptions
- All assumptions will be clearly marked in documents
- User can review and correct assumptions later
- **Risk**: May need significant rework if assumptions are wrong

### Option B: Wait for User Input
- AI will pause and wait for user to answer critical questions
- More accurate and targeted output
- Longer initial generation time
- **Benefit**: Higher quality, fewer revisions needed

### Option C: Hybrid Approach
- AI will proceed with safe assumptions for non-critical items
- Will pause only for high-impact questions
- User can provide answers incrementally

## Next Steps

1. **If Option A**: AI continues with assumptions, generates all documents
2. **If Option B**: AI waits for user responses to critical questions
3. **If Option C**: AI proceeds with safe assumptions, flags high-impact items

**User Decision**: [ ] Option A  [ ] Option B  [ ] Option C

**Additional Notes**: [User can add any specific instructions here]
